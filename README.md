# music_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
This project is basic app for music player.
This project is made by using flutter and dart.
In this Project I have used Hive for storing data locally, Bloc for state management, and AudioPlayer for playing music.
I have use Music_player package for getting songs from the network.
Through this app you can play songs from the network and also from your local storage(in Future).
You can do basic operations like play, pause, and seek bar.
I have use Firebase for authentication and also for database for songs data.
